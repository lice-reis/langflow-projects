# Save File Component - Major Improvements & Bug Fixes

## Overview
This PR introduces significant improvements to the Save File component, enhancing its functionality, user experience, and reliability. The component now provides better data handling, improved configuration options, and fixes critical bugs that prevented proper integration with other components.

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced File Name Field
**Before:** Only accepted string input via `StrInput`
**After:** Now accepts both string and Message node inputs via `MessageTextInput`

- **Benefit:** Users can now dynamically generate file names using Message nodes from previous components
- **Implementation:** Changed from `StrInput` to `MessageTextInput` with automatic type conversion
- **Code Change:**
  ```python
  # Before
  StrInput(name="file_name", ...)
  
  # After  
  MessageTextInput(name="file_name", ...)
  ```

### 2. Custom Directory Path Support
**Before:** Files were always saved in the current working directory
**After:** Users can specify custom directory paths for file storage

- **Benefit:** Better file organization and user control over file locations
- **Implementation:** Added new `MessageTextInput` field for directory path with automatic directory creation
- **Code Addition:**
  ```python
  MessageTextInput(
      name="directory_path",
      display_name="Directory Path",
      info="Directory where the file will be saved. Leave empty to use current working directory.",
      required=False,
  )
  ```

### 3. Critical Bug Fix - Output Node Connection
**Before:** Output node had connection issues preventing integration with other components
**After:** Fixed output node properly connects to downstream components

- **Benefit:** Component can now be properly integrated into workflows
- **Implementation:** Corrected output configuration and return value handling
- **Code Change:**
  ```python
  # Before: Buggy output handling
  return Message(text=f"{confirmation} at {final_path}")
  
  # After: Clean, reliable output
  return Message(text=str(final_path))
  ```

### 4. Enhanced Data Format Support
**Before:** Limited support for converting JSON data to CSV format
**After:** Robust handling of various data structures including lists of dictionaries

- **Benefit:** Users can now save JSON data as CSV, Excel, Markdown, or preserve as JSON
- **Implementation:** Added intelligent DataFrame creation with proper data structure detection
- **Code Addition:**
  ```python
  def _create_dataframe_from_data(self, data) -> pd.DataFrame:
      """Create a DataFrame from data, handling different data structures properly."""
      if isinstance(data, list) and len(data) > 0:
          if isinstance(data[0], dict):
              # List of dictionaries - perfect for DataFrame
              return pd.DataFrame(data)
          # ... additional handling for other data types
  ```

### 5. File Format Configuration Enhancement
**Before:** File format was optional and hidden in advanced settings
**After:** File format is now a required basic configuration field

- **Benefit:** Better user experience with clear format selection requirement
- **Implementation:** Moved from `advanced=True` to main configuration panel with `required=True`
- **Code Change:**
  ```python
  # Before
  DropdownInput(..., advanced=True, required=False)
  
  # After
  DropdownInput(..., required=True)  # No more advanced=True
  ```

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Data Type Handling
- **Enhanced Input Type Detection:** Improved logic for detecting and handling different input types
- **List Processing:** Added support for lists of Data, DataFrame, and Message objects
- **Robust DataFrame Creation:** Intelligent handling of nested data structures

### Error Handling
- **Better Validation:** Improved input validation with clear error messages
- **Format Compatibility:** Dynamic format validation based on input type
- **Excel Support:** Added Excel format support for Data objects with proper validation

### Code Quality
- **Cleaner Architecture:** Removed unused methods and simplified code structure
- **Better Documentation:** Improved method documentation and inline comments
- **Consistent Patterns:** Standardized approach across all save methods

## 📊 Supported Formats

| Input Type | CSV | Excel | JSON | Markdown | TXT |
|------------|-----|-------|------|----------|-----|
| DataFrame  | ✅  | ✅    | ✅   | ✅       | ❌  |
| Data       | ✅  | ✅    | ✅   | ✅       | ❌  |
| Message    | ❌  | ❌    | ✅   | ✅       | ✅  |

## 🧪 Testing

The component has been thoroughly tested with:
- ✅ JSON data conversion to CSV
